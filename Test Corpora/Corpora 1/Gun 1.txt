A gun is a weapon designed to discharge a projectile. The projectile may be solid, liquid, gas or energy and may be free, as with bullets and
artillery shells, or captive as with Taser probes and whaling harpoons. The means of projection varies according to design but is usually effected
by the action of gas pressure, either produced through the rapid combustion of a propellant or compressed and stored by mechanical means, operating
on the projectile inside an open-ended tube in the fashion of a piston. The confined gas accelerates the movable projectile down the length of the
tube imparting sufficient velocity to sustain the projectile's travel once the action of the gas ceases at the end of the tube or muzzle.
Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed in which case the tube may be dispensed with and a guide rail
substituted.
