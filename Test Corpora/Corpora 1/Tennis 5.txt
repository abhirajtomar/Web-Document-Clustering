Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant color was gradually changed to Optic Yellow in the
latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and
bounce criteria to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41-68.58 mm
(2.575-2.700 inches). Balls must weigh between 56.0 g and 59.4 g
Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampers may be interlaced in the proximal part of the
string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players
often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized
tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.
