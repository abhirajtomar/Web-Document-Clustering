The rules of tennis have not changed much since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground
at all times, and the adoption of the tie-break in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review
technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to challenge the line (or chair) umpire's call of a point. Players have
unlimited opportunities to challenge provided the challenges made are correct. However, once three incorrect challenges are made in a set, they
cannot challenge again until the next set. If the set goes to a tie-break, players are given one additional opportunity to challenge the call. This
electronic review, called Hawk-Eye, is available at a limited number of high-level ATP and WTA tournaments.
Tennis is enjoyed by millions of recreational players and is also a hugely popular worldwide spectator sport, especially the four Grand Slam
tournaments (also referred to as the "Majors") the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon
played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts.
