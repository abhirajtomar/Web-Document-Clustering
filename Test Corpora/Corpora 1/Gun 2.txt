In ordinary speech the term gun may refer to any sort of firearm including those that are usually hand-held (handgun). The word gun is also
commonly used to describe objects which, while they are not themselves weapons, produce an effect or possess a form which is in some way evocative
of a handgun or longarm. However, in contemporary military and naval parlance the term gun has a very specific meaning and refers solely to any
large-calibre, direct-fire, high-velocity, flat-trajectory artillery piece employing an explosive-filled hollowed metal shell or solid bolt as its
primary projectile. This later usage contrasts with large-calibre, high-angle, low-velocity, indirect-fire weapons such as howitzers, mortars, and
grenade launchers which invariantly employ explosive-filled shells.
