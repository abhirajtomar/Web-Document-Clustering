Most guns use compressed gas confined by the barrel to propel the bullet up to high speed, though devices operating in other ways are sometimes
called guns. In guns that are firearms the high pressure gas is generated by combustion, usually of gun powder. This principle is similar to that
of internal combustion engines, except that the bullet leaves the barrel while the piston transfers its motion to other parts and returns down the
cylinder. As in an internal combustion engine, the combustion propagates by deflagration rather than by detonation, and the optimal gunpowder, like
the optimal motor fuel, is resistant to detonation. This is because much of the energy generated in detonation is in the form of a shock wave,
which can propagate from the gas to the solid structure and heat or damage the structure, rather than staying as heat to propel the piston or
bullet. The shock wave at such high temperature and pressure is much faster than that of any bullet, and would leave the gun as sound either
through the barrel or the bullet itself rather than contributing to the bullet's velocity.
