Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France
was a keen player of jeu de paume, which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the
modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis out of doors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the
13th century". In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. Unfortunately, in June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne
and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy,
although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player
known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.
It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called "tennis", from the Old French term tenez, which can
be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and
France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which
is now known as real tennis. During the 18th century and early 19th century, as real tennis declined, new rackets sports emerged in England
