Dance is a type of art that generally involves movement of the body, often rhythmic and to music. It is performed in many cultures as a form of
emotional expression, social interaction, or exercise, in a spiritual or performance setting, and is sometimes used to express ideas or tell a
story. Dance may also be regarded as a form of nonverbal communication between humans or other animals, as in bee dances and behaviour patterns
such as a mating dances.
Definitions of what constitutes dance can depend on social and cultural norms and aesthetic, artistic and moral sensibilities. Definitions may
range from functional movement (such as folk dance) to virtuoso techniques such as ballet. Martial arts kata are often compared to dances, and
sports such as gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are generally thought to incorporate dance. In some cases, the motion of
ordinarily inanimate objects may be described as dance
