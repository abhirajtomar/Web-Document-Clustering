Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this "sweet chocolate", and
requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[35] Dark chocolate, with its high cocoa
content, is a rich source of epicatechin and gallic acid, which are thought to possess cardioprotective properties. Dark chocolate has also been
said to reduce the possibility of a heart attack when consumed regularly in small amounts.[38] Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low
sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter, vanilla and sometimes lecithin
have been added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking.
