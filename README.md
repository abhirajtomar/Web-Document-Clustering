Web-Document-Clustering
=======================
The project involves the clustering of web documents using various data mining techniques. 
Implementation of a corpora based query search module using TF-IDF model, Latent Semantic Analysis, 
Singular Value Decomposition, Latent Dirichlet Allocation etc. 
For implementing the various language processing models, I have utilised Gensim, an open-source vector space modeling and 
topic modeling toolkit.
I have developed a new algorithm for clustering web documents using Latent Semantic Indexing and Minimum Cut Theorem 
for graphs and I have also implemented a ranking algorithm which ranks web documents with respect to a submitted query.
The main code is in the file clustering_lsi_with_ranking.py.
